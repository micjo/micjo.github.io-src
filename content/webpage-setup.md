Summary: Experiences starting my first blog post

For personal development and portfolio showcasing, it makes sense 
to start a blog. I had already heard of github-pages and when 
pitching the idea to a friend he was quick to recommend jeckyll.

I was handed 3 tutorials to follow and was a little overwhelmed at first. 
There were quite a few difficulties trying to run jekyll. The combination 
of permission problems, rbenv and various other packages I needed to install
were quick to drive me away from jekyll. 

Pelican to the rescue. This is an alternative to jekyll. It is a
python-based static webpage generator. I was amazed how quick it was
to get things up and running. [This blog](https://fedoramagazine.org/make-github-pages-blog-with-pelican/)
was a great help.

It is a bit odd to me that most, if not all, tutorials on github-pages mention
jekyll as the go-to static webpage generator. For me, Pelican is a much better 
fit, at least for now.
