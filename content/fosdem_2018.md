Summary: Seminars and impressions at FOSDEM 2018

# Fosdem 2018
Going to FOSDEM is always somewhat of a reality check.
You see how much you stay in your silo at work, 
how few women there are in our sector and 
how small the campus has gotten over the last few years.
Meeting old colleagues and learning 
new things always bring me back however.

There is never enough time to visit all the talks 
you want to go to. FOSDEM is a week worth of 
seminars condensed into 1 weekend.

## Day 1
| 12.00 | [How to keep your embedded linux device up and running](fosdem-2018-talk-01.html) |
| -- | -- |
| 12.45 | [Securing embedded systems using virtualization](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/vai_securing_embedded_systems/) |
| 13.30 | [Gstreamer for embedded devices](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/om_gst_embedded/)
| 14.00 | [Modern tools to debug GStreamer applications](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/om_gst_dbg/)
| 15.30 | [Piece of cake - testing remote embdded devices made easy](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/testing_remote_devices/)
| 17.00 | [Igniting the open hardware ecosystem with RISC-V](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/riscv/)
| 18.30 | [Gstreamer for tiny devices](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/gstreamer_for_tiny_devices/)

More and more speakers are (ab)using the term 'embedded' to lure in more attendants. 
Especially the talk on securing embedded devices was guilty of this

## Day 2
During this day i was responsible for the video stream in the IoT devroom. 
Sadly the second to last speaker was unable to make it, causing the last talk
to be nearly empty. On the demo tables there was a group of people from 
[HAMRADIO](https://www.uba.be/) showcasing an interesting SDR waterfall:

After cleaning the devroom there was still time to attend
one last [talk](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/closing_keynote/). This
room was packed. Meltdown and spectre are big news after all.
